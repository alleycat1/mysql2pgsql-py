py-mysql2pgsql - A tool for migrating/converting/exporting data from MySQL to PostgreSQL
========================================================================================

This tool allows you to take data from an MySQL server (only tested on
5.x) and write a PostgresSQL compatible (8.2 or higher) dump file or pipe it directly
into your running PostgreSQL server (8.2 or higher).

.. attention::
   Currently there is no support for importing `spatial data from MySQL
   <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/spatial-extensions.html>`_.


Installation:
=============

If you're like me you don't like random stuff polluting your python
install. Might I suggest installing this in an virtualenv?

::

    > virtualenv --no-site-packages ~/envs/py-mysql2pgsql
    > source ~/envs/py-mysql2pgsql/bin/activate


Requirements:
-------------

* `Python 2.7 <http://www.python.org/getit/>`_
* `MySQL-python <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/MySQL-python>`_
* `psycopg2 <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/psycopg2>`_
* `PyYAML <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyYAML>`_
* `termcolor <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/termcolor>`_ (unless you're installing on windows)
* `pytz <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytz>`_


On Windows
----------

I have only done limited testing on this platform using Python
2.7. Here are the driver dependencies for windows, install these
before attempting to install py-mysql2pgsql or it will fail.

* `psycopg2 for Windows <http://www.stickpeople.com/projects/python/win-psycopg/>`_
* `MySQL-python for Windows <http://www.codegood.com/archives/129>`_



From PyPI:
----------

All dependencies **should** be automatically installed when installing
the app the following ways

::

    > pip install py-mysql2pgsql


From source:
------------

::

    > git clone git://github.com/philipsoutham/py-mysql2pgsql.git
    > cd py-mysql2pgsql
    > python setup.py install


Usage:
======

Looking for help?

::

    > py-mysql2pgsql -h
    usage: py-mysql2pgsql [-h] [-v] [-f FILE]

    Tool for migrating/converting data from mysql to postgresql.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -v, --verbose         Show progress of data migration.
      -f FILE, --file FILE  Location of configuration file (default:
                            mysql2pgsql.yml). If none exists at that path,
                            one will be created for you.


Don't worry if this is your first time, it'll be gentle.

::

    > py-mysql2pgsql
    No configuration file found.
    A new file has been initialized at: mysql2pgsql.yml
    Please review the configuration and retry...

As the output suggests, a file was created at mysql2pgsql.yml for you
to edit. For the impatient, here is what the file contains.

::

    # a socket connection will be selected if a 'socket' is specified
    # also 'localhost' is a special 'hostname' for MySQL that overrides the 'port' option
    # and forces it to use a local socket connection
    # if tcp is chosen, you can use compression

    mysql:
     hostname: localhost
     port: 3306
     socket: /tmp/mysql.sock
     username: mysql2psql
     password: 
     database: mysql2psql_test
     compress: false
    destination:
     # if file is given, output goes to file, else postgres
     file: 
     postgres:
      hostname: localhost
      port: 5432
      username: mysql2psql
      password: 
      database: mysql2psql_test

    # if only_tables is given, only the listed tables will be converted.  leave empty to convert all tables.
    #only_tables:
    #- table1
    #- table2
    # if exclude_tables is given, exclude the listed tables from the conversion.
    #exclude_tables:
    #- table3
    #- table4

    # if supress_data is true, only the schema definition will be exported/migrated, and not the data
    supress_data: false

    # if supress_ddl is true, only the data will be exported/imported, and not the schema
    supress_ddl: false

    # if force_truncate is true, forces a table truncate before table loading
    force_truncate: false

    # if timezone is true, forces to append/convert to UTC tzinfo mysql data
    timezone: false
    
    # if index_prefix is given, indexes will be created whith a name prefixed with index_prefix
    index_prefix:

Pretty self explanatory right? A couple things to note, first if
`destination -> file` is populated all output will be dumped to the
specified location regardless of what is contained in `destination ->
postgres`. So if you want to dump directly to your server make sure
the `file` value is blank.

Say you have a MySQL db with many, many tables, but you're only
interested in exporting a subset of those table, no problem. Add only
the tables you want to include in `only_tables` or tables that you
don't want exported to `exclude_tables`. 

Other items of interest may be to skip moving the data and just create
the schema or vice versa. To skip the data and only create the schema
set `supress_data` to `true`. To migrate only data and not recreate the
tables set `supress_ddl` to `true`; if there's existing data that you
want to drop before importing set `force_truncate` to
`true`. `force_truncate` is not necessary when `supress_ddl` is set to
`false`.

Note that when migrating, it's sometimes possible to knock your 
sequences out of whack. When this happens, you may get IntegrityErrors 
about your primary keys saying things like, "duplicate key value violates 
unique constraint." See `this page <https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Fixing_Sequences>`_ for a fix

Due to different naming conventions in mysql an postgresql, there is a chance
that the tool generates index names that collide with table names. This can
be circumvented by setting index_prefix.

One last thing, the `--verbose` flag. Without it the tool will just go
on it's merry way without bothering you with any output until it's
done. With it you'll get a play-by-play summary of what's going
on. Here's an example.

::

    > py-mysql2pgsql -v -f mysql2pgsql.yml
    START PROCESSING table_one
      START  - CREATING TABLE table_one
      FINISH - CREATING TABLE table_one

Data Type Conversion Legend
===========================

Since there is not a one-to-one mapping between MySQL and
PostgreSQL data types, listed below are the conversions that are applied. I've
taken some liberties with some, others should come as no surprise.

==================== ===========================================

set                  ARRAY[]::text[]
==================== ===========================================


Conversion caveats:
===================

Not just any valid MySQL database schema can be simply converted to the
PostgreSQL. So when you end with a different database schema please note that:

* Most MySQL versions don't enforce `NOT NULL` constraint on `date` and `enum`
  fields. Because of that `NOT NULL` is skipped for this types. Here's an
  excuse for the dates: `<http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=59526>`_.

About:
======

I ported much of this from an existing project written in Ruby by Max
Lapshin over at `<https://github.com/maxlapshin/mysql2postgres>`_. I
found that it worked fine for most things, but for migrating large tables
with millions of rows it started to break down. This motivated me to
write *py-mysql2pgsql* which uses a server side cursor, so there is no "paging"
which means there is no slow down while working it's way through a
large dataset.
